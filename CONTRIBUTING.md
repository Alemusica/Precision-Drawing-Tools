# General

Contributions to this project are most welcome, however, I  am not keen at the moment to allow others to contribute directly.

If you think the code should be altered, improved, or augmented, please log an issue with your proposed alterations and I will evaluate this and integrate all improving ideas.

I will not accept "Change this because I don't like it" type requests, but thought-through requests with suggested new code will be given careful considerations.

# Code Standards

Please make all code changes pep8 compliant and supply comments explaining what, why and how.

Contributors are expected to run their code through `pylint` before submitting pull requests or committing code.

## Code Formatting

Run you code through the [black](https://github.com/psf/black/) code formatting tool with `black -l100`

## Google Docstrings

Use Google docstrings to document code. Examples [here](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/docstrings-python#sixth-sub).
